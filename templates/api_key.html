            Applying for jobs has gotten noticeably more difficult over the past few years.
            More companies are using advanced AI technologies to quickly assess candidates for potential
            job openings, and job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn make it trivially easy to post a new job 
            opening to thousands of people in seconds. Apply for a job feels now like a question of quantity 
            rather than quality.
